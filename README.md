# COMP370-Data-Analysis-Projects

This directory contains different types of mini projects showcasing techniques for the various stages of the data analysis process.

## Troll Tweet Analysis
In this project, we will conduct an analysis of tweets produced by Russian trolls during the 2016 US election. These tweets were published by 538. We’ll be assessing the frequency with which troll tweets mention “Trump” by name.

## NYC 311 Analysis
This project touches upon data visualization using Bokeh dashboards and matplotlib to allow New York city leaders to explore the discrepancy in service across zipcodes. This would allow us to infer bias in the handling of service requests across the city of New York.
